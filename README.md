### Hi there, my name is VitÃ³ria ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at 55PBX and Computer Informational Systems student at University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).

At my job, I work mainly with technologies: Node.js, ReactJS, React Native, Redux and Styled-Components, with JavaScript and TypeScript, and MongoDB and MySQL databases.

Currently, at my spare time, I'm focusing on improving my knowledge in:
  - ðŸŽ¨ Accessible and responsive webdesign
  - ðŸŒ€ Event loop, child process and cluster with Node.js

Let's talk about these topics!
